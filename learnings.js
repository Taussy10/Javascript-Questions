// Terminalogy: Container = variable 

//1. Null vs Undefined

// look we need a help of variable 
// When we declare a variable then there can be two scenerios 
// 1. We want to store some values in it 
// 2. we don't want store any values in it 

// We are gonna talk about 2nd point 

// In this two things can happen 

// Either you can store value or not store value yeah hard to believe 
// even in empty you can store empty 

let b;        // Yeh empty hai, kyunki maine kuchh value nahi store kra 
//  I didn't decleared value of b 
let a = null; // Yeh empty hai, kyunki maine value store kra hai null(means nothing ) 

// In english: 
// undefined: assigned by js when a variable is declare but value is not assigned 
// Null: Null is data type in javascript that represenet intentional 
// absence of of any value  



//2. type of NAN: number
